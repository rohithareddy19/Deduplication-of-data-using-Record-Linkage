# Deduplication-of-data-using-Record-Linkage

In real word we come across data that is redundant and this is where record linkage comes. This is a process in which records from different data sources are matched based on different attributes.

For example, for a reatil store where the same customer goes to multiple locations and would like to know the total active customers. Without deduplication the active count would be more than it is supposed to be. Using record linkage the data can be deduplicated using data points like customer name, email, address and phone number etc.
